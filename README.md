#  Coming Soon: Full Web App Experience
This is just the beginning. I'm turning this AI-driven resource cookbook into a full-featured web app – not just for free resources, but also curated premium content across various categories.
Whether you're a beginner or a pro, expect smart recommendations, categorized content, and tools designed to accelerate your learning.

# My-Resources
This repository contains a list of websites and tools I use regularly as a developer. I've created this collection to share with fellow developers in hopes that you'll find it useful and time-saving.

I focus on including as many free resources as possible to support those just starting out or working on a budget. However, I’ve also added some paid tools that are reasonably priced and worth considering.

The list is updated daily, so feel free to check back often for new additions.
